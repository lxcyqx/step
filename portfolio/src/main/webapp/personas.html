        <div class="body-text">
          In this project for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experiences,
          taught by
          <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Huang</a>, we
          were asked to choose one interface we have interacted with and
          analyzing it using concepts of mental models and personas. My partner
          for this project was Kate Atschinow, and we chose to analyze the self
          checkout machine.

          Description
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          The self checkout machine is an alternative for customers to purchase
          items as opposed to going up to a traditional cashier. It helps to
          shorten checkout lanes and reduce wait times. Customers scan their
          items and pay using their preferred method of payment, usually cash or
          credit, but the machines at the local CVS do not accept cash. The self
          checkout machine contains four main components: the touchscreen
          display, item scanner, credit card reader, and bagging area. Customers
          scan each item barcode, place the item in the bag, which is verified
          by weight against previously stored information, press the appropriate
          buttons touchscreen display, and then make their payment via their
          preferred method.

          Behavioral Observation
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          While observing customers, we noticed that the line for the self
          checkout was much longer than that for the cashier. After one customer
          finished bagging and walked away, the next person in line would walk
          up to the machine. For the most part, users were able to go through
          the checkout process efficiently. We observed customers’ interactions
          with using the self checkout machine and came up with a list of
          observations about customer behavior and attitudes while using self
          checkout.

          <ul>
            <li>
              One customer had to request for help when the machine was unable
              to process one of his items, and he had to wait around until a
              staff member came to help him.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many customers went up to the self checkout with a friend and the
              friend would sometimes assist in pressing the correct buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Several customers clicked the “Skip Bagging” option, especially
              when their items were small, and did not place their items on the
              scale.
            </li>

        <div class="subtitle">User Interviews</div>
        <div class="body-text bold">
          Do you prefer self checkout or going to the cashier?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: I prefer self checkout.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: Self checkout
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          What are some reasons you prefer one over the other?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: Because I don’t want to interact with the cashier, and I
            feel like it (the cashier) definitely takes more time.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: The self-checkout usually has a faster line and I don’t have
            to talk to anyone.
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          How likely are you to use the self checkout machine as opposed to
          going to the cashier?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: I’ll use the self checkout all the time unless I have too
            many items or there’s a huge line for the self checkout
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: Very likely. I only use the cashier when I’m using cash or a
            machine isn’t working.
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          What do you think can be improved with the user interface of the self
          checkout machine?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: I feel like it’s already pretty straight forward but
            sometimes the scanning is too sensitive so then it’ll scan your item
            twice. And then other times if you have too light of an object, like
            let’s say you bought nail polish and you put it down in the bag it
            won’t detect that you have it in the bag so it’ll keep waiting for
            you to put it in the bag. But then you can just say “skip bagging”
            and then scan the next item.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: After I scan an item it doesn’t always register when I put
            it down in a bag. I’ve also had problems with it reading my credit
            card when I put the chip in. Also sometimes it takes multiple tries
            for the scanner to scan my item.
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          Are there any parts of the interface that you find confusing?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: No, but also I’m not someone who uses coupons. But if I were
            to have coupons I would be confused as to how to use it. Normally
            it’s pretty straight forward. I just use my credit card.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: When I bring my own bag or don’t need a bag sometimes I
            don’t know if I should press the button for using my own bag or skip
            bagging because I have had to press both before.
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          If you could change any features of the design, how would you?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: I think the Amazon concept is nice, where you can just take
            the item and leave. It’s convenient that it’s checkout free and you
            just get charged through your Amazon account. But some people think
            it feels like shoplifting.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: I would make it more clear exactly where you should put the
            item you’re scanning so you don’t have to just wave it around. Also
            make it easier to choose your own bag or skip bagging.
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          How does this self checkout machine compare to self checkout machines
          you have used in other stores?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: The only other one I’ve used is Target and it’s exactly the
            same. There’s no discrepancy. I’m pretty sure it’s the same exact
            interface as well.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: The only difference I’ve noticed is that the other ones have
            a security monitor which doesn’t necessarily affect my experience
            with it.
          </ul>
          <br />
          Most people that we observed using the self checkout machine were
          college students, mostly because CVS is located right by Brown
          University. This particular sample is not a good representation of the
          range of people that may be using self checkout machines in other CVS
          stores, where there are likely to be more customers who are older.
          Older customers may have less experience with technology and find it
          more confusing than the population we observed. However, the people we
          observed were representative of the people who frequent the CVS on
          Thayer Street. We went on different times of the day, and as expected,
          mostly saw students along with a few Providence residents who are not
          students.

          Mental Models and Personas
        </div>
        <div class="body-text bold">Mental Model #1:</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          The user selects “Use my own bag” and then places the item in their
          reusable bag after scanning. However, an error occurs and the machine
          does not let them scan their next item. The user does not press the
          “Skip Bagging” option because they want to place their items in a bag.
          They cannot figure out what is going wrong, so they press “Request
          Help”. The user’s mental model blocks the user from identifying a way
          to resolving the issue, which is likely to have been caused by the
          weight detector not being able to detect the item on the scale. The
          user does not understand that “skip bagging” would help them bypass
          the weight detector error, and they do not click on it because they
          want to place their items in a bag. Because of this, the user becomes
          stressed because they are not able to identify why they cannot use
          their reusable bag.

        <div class="body-text bold">Mental Model #2:</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          The user scans the item and places it in the plastic bag. The weight
          detector does not detect that an item has been placed there, and the
          user is not able to scan the next item. They notice that there is a
          “Skip Bagging” option so they press it, thinking that the items are
          small enough to carry without a bag and that maybe the button will
          help skip past the weight detector not being able to detect the item
          and override the scale’s inability to detect items whose weights are
          out of range. They are then able to move onto scanning their next
          item. The user’s mental model of the self checkout machine was that
          the “skip bagging” option would allow them to bypass the weight
          detector, so they were able to resolve their issue and purchase their
          item quickly, though initially with slight confusion due to not being
          able to scan the next item.

          Rushed Robert is a student at Brown University who likes to use his
          time efficiently. He always looks for a way to do things as quickly as
          possible so he can keep up with his busy lifestyle. He is constantly
          juggling his work from his engineering classes, soccer practice, and
          hanging out with his friends. With the goal of saving time, he chooses
          self checkout because the line is shorter. He uses the plastic bags
          for the sake of convenience because he doesn’t want to have to carry
          around a reusable bag on top of his athletic gear. His ability to
          problem solve allows him to identify the cause of the machine
          malfunction. Rushed Robert is like many students and wants to make his
          purchases and leave the store as quickly as possible with minimal
          interactions with other people in the store.

          Conclusion

        <div class="body-text">
          Throughout this process of conducting behavioral observations and user
          interviews, we were able to gauge customers’ general feelings
          self-checkout. Based on our observations, more customers preferred
          using the self-checkout machine. Though it seemed to be the more
          popular option for purchasing items as compared to going up to an
          employee, there were also issues that customers faced such as the
          machine not being able to detect scanned items that were outside of
          the weight range. It was helpful to think of mental models and
          personas to better understand how different users might feel about the
          process of self-checkout and how they reacted when an issue occurred.
