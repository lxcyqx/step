          Taxi Booking Site
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          For this project, we created two new and improved versions of a taxi
          booking site, as shown in Image 1. For Version A, we created used a
          vertical layout. We added grid boxes around each taxi option and added
          a drop shadow to emphasize the different sections. Additionally, we
          used different font sizes for the name of the taxi and the description
          to add distinction between the different pieces of information. For
          Version B, we used a horizontal layout that placed all of the taxi
          options next to each other contained within the whole screen. We also
          added grid boxes around each taxi to make the content more readable.
          For both of these versions, we decided to use the same color palette
          so that color was not a factor that played into how users would
          interact with the site. Instead, we wanted to focus on how our two
          different layouts would affect behavioral trends such as click through
          rate, time to click, dwell time, and return rate.

          Part 1: A/B Testing

        <div class="body-text">
          First, we made a series of hypotheses on how the two versions of our
          sites would perform based on four metrics (click through rate, time to
          click, dwell time, and return rate). Then, we tested our hypotheses by
          having users navigate through one of our two sites and analyzed the
          data to conclude whether our results are statistically significant,
          using either Chi-Squared test of T-test.

          <ul>
            Alternative: The click-through rate of Version A will be greater
            than that of Version B because the layout of Version A is cleaner
            and entices the user to select a service offered.

          <ul>
            Alternative: The time to click a button on Version A will be shorter
            than that of Version B because the button on Version A is larger,
            and there is less content on the initial screen for Version A
            compared to Version B.

          <ul>
            Alternative: The dwell for Version A will be shorter than that of
            Version B because users of Version B see all taxi companies on the
            page at once and are more likely to choose to click on a company
            that they will likely stick with.

            Alternative: The return rate for Version A will be higher than the
            return rate for Version B because users of Version B see more
            content on the screen and are more likely to read the information
            for all of the taxi companies before clicking on the reserve button.
            On the other hand, users of Version A see less content on the screen
            and are more likely to click on the reserve button before fully
            reading information for the other taxi companies, thus causing them
            to return back to the web page.

          We began by creating a pivot table in Excel with count of page load

          Part 2: Eyetracking
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          For eye tracking portion of this project, we were able to use an eye
          tracker on two participants, one for each version of the site. Then,
          we used Javascript and Python to create a heat-map and an animated
          replay of the users’ eye movements based off of data collected from
          each eye tracking sessions (shown on the next page).

          Hypotheses
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We instructed the user to book the cheapest taxi. Our hypothesis is
          that users of Version A will focus on the descriptions and spend more
          time searching for the taxi that they want to click due to having to
          scroll through options. Meanwhile, users of Version B are able to view
          all of the information at once since it is all contained on one
          screen, so they will not look at the information as closely and click
          on a button in a shorter amount of time. Since our instruction of the
          eye-tracking experiment is different from that of the A/B testing data
          collection (to simply choose a taxi), our hypotheses differ a little
          from Part 1.

          Interpretation of Visualizations

        <div class="body-text">
          The eye tracking data shows that the user for Version A focused on the
          description section for each section as they scrolled through the site
          while the user for Version B does not focus on the description as much
          and looks at the images before they click on a button. Additionally,
          the number of data points show that the user for Version A spent a
          longer time on the site than the user for Version B. Thus, our
          findings support our hypothesis.

          Part 3: Comparison
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Based on the data analysis and eye-tracking results, we propose that
          Memphis Taxis Co. uses Interface A due to its higher click-through
          rate and lower click time. The percentage of click-through rate of
          Interface A (85.3%) is higher than that of Interface B (73.7%), which
          might be caused by the cleaner design in simplifying information
          retrieval and the decision-making process. Moreover, the average time
          to click for Interface A (8847.86 ms) is lower than that of Interface
          B (9119.82 ms), which suggests that Interface A’s vertical layout
          helps people consider options individually and make quicker decisions,
          unlike Interface B where users reads and compares each option before
          deciding. The eye-tracking heatmap shows that Interface A’s user
          focused on several descriptions before making her final decision and
          had a longer click time than Interface B’s eye-tracking user, contrary
          to the results of our A/B Test, which is due to a different command
          given to the user. Therefore, despite the results that advocates for
          the use of Interface A, we should conduct more tests to achieve
          statistically significant results and use the same commands for A/B
          data collection and eye-tracking.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          When comparing data for eye-tracking and A/B testing, we noticed that
          in eye tracking, there is no measurement for behavioral trends such as
          return rate and dwell time because once the user clicks on a button,
          the eyetracking session ends. The advantage with using A/B testing
          over eye tracking is that with A/B testing is that you are able to get
          more data related to time and when users leave the site, such as
          return rate and dwell time. On the other hand, the advantage of using
          eye tracking over A/B testing is that you can find where on the screen
          users are looking which helps inform the areas on the screen that grab
          the users’ attention most, thus informing particular design choices on
          the screen that should be made. The visual representation of the heat
          map can be used to make direct comparisons between versions to show
          whether certain changes have an effect on eye movement.

          One metric that could be used unethically would be click through rate
          if images or text are intentionally misleading in order to get users
          to click on it. Another metric that could be used unethically would be
          conversion rate which is the number of conversions (people who
          completed a desired goal) divided by the total number of visitors.
          This can be used to make users make unwanted purchases without taking
          into consideration what is most desirable for the user.

          Conclusion
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          This project effectively combines design with data collection. We used
          the eye tracker to create a heatmap which offered different data
          visualization from that of the A/B Testing results. Both provided
          insightful results to how users interact with the two different sites.
          To further build onto this project, we would keep our hypotheses for
          A/B Testing and eye-tracking more consistent and conduct tests on a
          larger group of users that are not in our class.
