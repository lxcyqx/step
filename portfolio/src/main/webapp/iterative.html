          This project was made for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User
          Experiences, a class at Brown University taught by
          <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Huang</a>. Our
          goal was to choose a startup and based off of only a short summary of
          the goals of the startup, we had to design an interface and perform
          user testing.

          412 Food Rescue
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We were inspired to design a mobile app for 412 Food Rescue, a
          start-up that instantaneously redistributes surplus food from
          retailers to food banks. Instead of making a website, we chose to
          create a mobile app because it would make it easier for restaurants to
          take photos of leftover food and for volunteers to navigate while
          driving.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          We started brainstorming our ideas for the design based off of a blurb
          in an article that was written about the startup on Carnegie Mellon
          University’s website:
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          “Co-founded by Leah Lizarondo, 412 Food Rescue partners with food
          retailers and other suppliers to pick up their healthy surplus food
          and deliver it to community nonprofit organizations, where it is
          directed to individuals and families experiencing food insecurity.”
        </div>

        <br />
        <div class="subtitle">
          Pre-Design Questions
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          Before starting the design process, we considered how our app might
          affect various groups of people and addressed the following questions.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">
          Who is directly affected by the interface?
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          People directly impacted include the restaurants and organizations
          that want to donate leftover food, the volunteers, the people who
          receive food from food banks, and the people working at the food
          banks.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">
          Who is indirectly affected by the interface?
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          People indirectly impacted are garbage collectors who might be laid
          off due to less need to pick up trash. Another group is restaurant
          customers because they are encouraged to visit stores that advertise
          itself as zero waste with 412 Food Rescue rather than non-green
          stores.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">
          How are these mentioned groups affected by the interface?
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          Restaurants can now efficiently distribute food to shelters through
          volunteers and reduce waste. However, food banks will have an influx
          of donations, which might negatively affect the workflow of employees
          there. Nevertheless, the increase in food can improve the quality of
          life for those who face food insecurity.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">
          What are the ethical concerns?
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          The emphasis on immediate delivery neglects the negative consequences
          of transportation’s gas emissions. It is difficult to balance
          eco-friendly transportation while maintaining the quality of the food
          (volunteers can choose to ride scooters but that might cause bruises
          in food).

          User Flow and Low Fidelity Wireframes
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          To begin, we mapped out the user journey of three groups of people -
          food retailers, volunteers, food banks - and integrated the flow in
          our wireframes.

          Food Providers

        <div class="body-text">
          Food retailers will post their leftover food on the app, and be
          notified when a volunteer picks it up. After the volunteer picks up
          the food, retailers confirm the pickup.

          From the wireframes, we modified the UI to improve usability.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Added a page that lists information about the delivery such as the
              addresses of pickup and drop-off after the volunteer selects their
              task.

              On the map screen, we dedicated it to location based navigation

          Final Changes from In-class Critique
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          For the interactive prototype, we decided to focus on the volunteer’s
          user flow because food delivery is the main focus of the startup.
          After presenting our high-fidelity prototype of the volunteer user
          flow to the class, we noticed that our main problems include
          legibility and clarity of task, which can interfere with the
          efficiency of the volunteer. Therefore, we resolved these problems as
          follows

          <ul>
            <li>
              Darkened the body text and bolded fonts
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Added duration of drive to task information page
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Removed the date and moved the profile icon there for easy access
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Allow volunteer to interactively click the phone or message button
              to contact the store/food bank
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On map screen, added immediate directions at the top and added a
              “End” button for the volunteer to exit the trip.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Added congratulatory message at the end of delivery

          few hours free in the afternoon and want to make some food deliveries
          from nearby restaurants to food banks. You will use the 412 Food
          Rescue app to select a delivery you want to make, pick up the food
          from the listed restaurant/store, and then deliver that food to the
          listed food bank/homeless shelter.

          Qualitative Analysis

        <div class="body-text bold">Error Type</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          On average, all three users commented that the navigation is
          intuitive, as supported by a complete rate of 100%. However, Samueltom
          made a planning error and assumed the Sign-In page was the Dashboard,
          therefore she described the wrong screen when asked to describe the
          functionality of the Dashboard. Her mental model of logging in was not
          the same as that of the prototype (where she assumed she can log in
          with the Google icon, so she did not click the usual Sign-in button),
          which resulted in her error.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">User Satisfaction</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Nevertheless, our low time on task averages support that the users are
          generally satisfied by the app’s simplicity, with Hksvij saying
          “Nothing is confusing.” Moreover, Samueltom mentioned that seeing her
          achievements at the end of delivery makes her feel an “adrenaline
          rush,” and Ibe noted that her accomplishment metrics keeps her
          engaged.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Overall it seems like our hypothesis was correct because our users
          were able to successfully use the app to make a delivery in about 2:45
          minutes which is very little time. When viewing the recorded videos on
          UserTesting, we can see that users spent the most time choosing
          between different food delivery posts and they navigated through the
          other pages fairly quickly. Therefore we can accept our hypothesis
          because users were able to make a delivery without getting distracted.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">Potential interface changes</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Ibe suggested making the profile page more descriptive by adding the
          color and model of the volunteer’s car, the approximate location for
          which they can deliver food, and the volunteer’s cell phone number. We
          can also add additional information on the confirm delivery and pickup
          pages to increase accessibility for users with disabilities. For deaf
          users, we can add a note informing restaurants that they should text
          the volunteer instead of calling them. Another user also suggested
          that we let volunteers schedule deliveries and pickups a few days in
          advance so they can plan out their week ahead of time.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text bold">UserTesting Experience</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          A challenge that we ran into during our UserTesting sessions was that
          we didn’t expect the user computer’s lag time to influence their
          interaction with the prototype. One user was confused when they
          clicked on a button and the next page did not appear due to the lag
          time of their computer. Another user tried to sign in using the
          Facebook button but couldn’t because we did not think that was a
          necessary screen to have for our prototype. In this case, we should
          have told users that they should sign in as if they already had an
          account instead of signing up as a new user. Overall, the users were
          able to follow our instructions very well. When we asked users to
          navigate to the profile page, they immediately clicked on the profile
          icon and understood all the information on the page.

        <div class="body-text">
          For this assignment, we were able to come up with a new design for an
          app simply based off of a description about a startup. Without looking
          at their existing website and app, we brainstormed how we thought the
          app should be laid out, therefore implementing user flow for the three
          types of users. Throughout the assignment, we made several changes
          from our low-fidelity mockups to the high-fidelity mockups and then
          further changes after the in-class critique. Over each iteration, we
          felt that we were able to make the app more user friendly and
          increased learnability and memorability. This certainly proved to be
          the case, as our testers were able to complete the given tasks with
          minimal confusion. If we were to build onto this project, we would add
          functionality to more of the buttons that we had included, such as the
          edit settings icon and the buttons on the sign in page.
