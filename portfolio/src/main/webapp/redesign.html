          Redesign was a project for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User
          Experiences, a course at Brown University taught by

          Our goal was to choose a site or app and redesign it using some of the
          usability principles we had learned in class.

          Wireframe
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We chose to redesign Book Depository, a UK based book retailer that is
          known for free delivery worldwide. Integrating UX principles of
          learnability, usability, and memorability, we improved the user
          experience of the website to aid the site’s intuitive navigation. We
          first analyzed the original website, prototyped low/high fidelity of a
          book information page, and then coded our responsive (4K widescreen
          desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile) designs with HTML/CSS.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text">
          Below are images of the original home page, sign in, book information,
          bestsellers, and basket screen. We noticed the large amount of
          content, especially on the home page and in the navigation bar, and
          thought about how we could simplify the pages while keeping the main
          functionalities.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text">
          We created five wireframes, one for each screen (home page, sign in,
          book information, bestsellers, and shopping basket). The main changes
          include simplifying the navigation bar, increasing the size of the
          books, and reducing large amounts of white space that did not
          contribute to breathability. These changes decluttered distracting
          content and additional words to increase usability by helping users
          focus on the page’s main functions.

            The next step in the project was to create a responsive website that
            would maintain visual appeal across different screen sizes. First,
            we adapted the designs to four screen sizes: standard desktop

            Design Choices
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            In creating a redesign, we first considered the most important
            features on the page and navigation from one page to another. Our
            redesign is a much more minimalistic version of the original site,
            but we made sure to include the important features on the page, such
            as the navigation bar, book cover, description, reviews, ratings,
            and footer. We simplified the navigation bar to only include the
            important aspects: logo, search bar, basket, profile, and “shop by
            category” drop down. Eliminating the additional components of the
            navigation bar that are in the original site still keeps the
            navigation flow intact while reducing the distractions from the
            additional words.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div class="body-text">
            The original website for Book Depository has three main colors: dark
            purple, blue, and hot pink. In our redesign, we changed the color
            palette to have one accent color to make the site more minimalistic
            and to unify the content. We chose a dark turquoise for the
            navigation bar, buttons, and footer. This accent color draws
            attention to the important parts on the screen while not being too
            bright and distracting. It also connotes intellectual curiosity and
            professionalism, aiding the credibility of the website.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div class="body-text">
            For font, we chose Helvetica Neue for readability and limited it to two
            font sizes (with the exception of the crossed out book price which is a
            third font) and used bolded words to highlight important phrases on the
            page. The original website uses a grid and has blocks around sections on
            the page to group important information together visually. We thought that
            these blocks were a good way to help with grouping content in a way that
            makes sense, so we included blocks in our redesign but increased the
            padding between the words and the border of the box to improve
            readability. We made the background of the web page a light gray color
            (similar to what is done in the original website) and in addition added a
            drop shadow to the boxes to further emphasize the distinction between
            various sections on the page.

          <div class="body-text">
            Our goal was to redesign an interface using the usability criteria and
            design principles that we learned in class. We chose a site that has room
            for improvement. Through this process, we were able to go from ideation to
            creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity mockups to making a responsive
            website using HTML and CSS.
