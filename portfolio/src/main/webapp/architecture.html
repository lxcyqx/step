          Experiments in Living

            As part of a semester-long project for HIAA 0100: Introduction to
            Architectural Design Studio, I iterated upon a series of spatial
            concepts to emphasize the relationship between abstract
            architectural ideas and the lived experience. This project is an
            investigation of how the house fundamentally constructs the
            interactions with those living together, transforming the way we
            live in how we navigate through social, work, and sleeping spaces.

            From the starting point of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Willits House, I
            reimagined and transformed its spatial concepts to the context of
            Providence in 2020. The precedent house is taken out of its original
            intent for the idealized nuclear family as more people in modern day
            are straying away from traditional gender roles and the notion of
            domesticity. New configurations of living are emerging, namely in
            the idea of the co-op. With the advent of new technology, there is a
            blur between the private and public space, as people are more
            connected to the outside world than ever before. These shifts in our
            interactions with the world thereby lead to the evolution of the
            relationship between leisure and work space, where the two sit in
            between a space of being separate and being one. Such changes all
            contribute to the need to reconsider the architectural formation of
            the house.

            The house goes far beyond Le Corbusier’s assertion that the “house
            is a machine from living.” It does not just serve for pure
            functionalism but rather, the house blends into the technological
            and cultural norms of the time. To further explore the house as
            something more than a structure that only fulfills the basic
            requirements of shelter, I visualized the Willits House as a series
            of volumes and took the relationships between these volumes to
            produce a new prototypical architecture designed for a group of five
            artists living together. Their interactions with each other and with
            social, work, and private spaces are emphasized in the circulation
            of the house as one moves from one space to another.
